Incubator
#########

The ``incubator`` submodule is there to hack around new format/feature support.

It's just there to make development easier, once something is reasonably stable
it should be moved out. In case of formats, they should be moved to their own
repos/packages. In case of features, move them to ``Image`` or other appropriate
places.
